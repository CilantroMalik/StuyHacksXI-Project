# StuyHacksXI-Project
Project for StuyHacks XI hackathon, held on January 15-16, 2022

## Ideas
#### python framwork
+ master dependency tree --> prevents different devs from constantly needing to update their dependency tree
+ run everything in docker --> doesn't constanly install things / mess with the filesystem like anaconda
+ GUI to install dependencies into the project
+ backend in Flask
