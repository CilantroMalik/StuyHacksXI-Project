# StuyHacksXI-Project
Project for StuyHacks XI hackathon, held on January 15-16, 2022

## Ideas
#### Python Framwork
+ master dependency tree --> prevents different devs from constantly needing to update their dependency tree
+ run everything in docker --> doesn't constanly install things / mess with the filesystem like anaconda
+ GUI to install dependencies into the project
+ backend in Flask
+ nice GUI / interface
  + more accessible to new devs
  + lowers the bar for beginners to engage with devtools

#### Book Tracker
+ log how far into a book you are
+ collaborative aspect
  + micro-communities
+ star books / push to friends
+ could be extended to any form of media
+ motivator to get people into reading

#### Google Docs Branching / Version Control
+ multiple panes to see what changes people are making simultaneously
+ too small of an audience?
